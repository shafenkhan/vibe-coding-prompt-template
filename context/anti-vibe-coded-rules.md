## Quick Self-Check (Before Shipping)

Ask yourself:
1. Would a designer at Stripe/Airbnb/Linear ship this?
2. Does every visual choice have a reason?
3. Is the spacing predictable and rhythmic?
4. Do all interactive elements actually work?
5. Is there anything here just for "vibes"?

If you hesitate on any question, fix it before shipping.
