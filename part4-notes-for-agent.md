# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Instructions for [App Name]

## 🎯 Project Overview

You're building **[App Name]** for someone with [technical level: limited coding experience/programming experience/basic coding knowledge]. Please:
- Explain [complex concepts simply/efficiently with best practices/concepts while teaching]
- Provide working code with clear comments
- [Additional guidance based on level]
- Balance simplicity with best practices

## 🎨 Design Quality Standards (CRITICAL)

> This section ensures your MVP looks premium, not "vibe-coded". These rules are non-negotiable.

### Core Design Directive

You are a senior product designer AND front-end engineer. Every UI output must show clarity, consistency, structure, and thoughtful design decisions. You build like someone who creates design systems for a living.

### Design System Requirements

**Spacing (8px Base Unit):**
- Use ONLY: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px
- NO random spacing values ever
- Consistent rhythm creates polish

**Typography:**
- Single heading font + single body font
- Clear hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 > Body > Caption
- Line-height 1.5-1.7 for body text

**Colors:**
- Limited, purposeful palette (5-7 colors max)
- High contrast (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- Semantic: success (green), error (red), warning (amber), info (blue)

**Components:**
- Same border-radius for same component types
- Consistent shadow style throughout
- ALL states: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error

### Anti-Vibe-Coded Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

❌ **NEVER** generate:
- Random purple gradients (unless brand-specified)
- Sparkle emoji/icons (max 1 per page, if any)
- Aggressive hover animations (bouncing, rotating, lifting cards)
- Fake testimonials with "Sarah P." or AI-generated faces
- Generic taglines ("Build your dreams", "Launch faster", "Create without limits")
- Inconsistent border-radius (4px here, 12px there, 32px elsewhere)
- Missing loading states (every async action needs feedback)
- Broken mobile responsiveness
- Buttons or links that do nothing
- Placeholder text in production

### Pre-Ship Checklist (Self-Check Before Completing UI Work)

- [ ] Spacing consistent and from the 8px scale?
- [ ] Typography hierarchy clear?
- [ ] All interactive elements actually functional?
- [ ] Loading states present for async operations?
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully?
- [ ] Mobile responsive at 375px, 768px, 1024px?
- [ ] Console error-free?
- [ ] Would Stripe/Airbnb/Linear ship this?

### Visual Verification Protocol

After ANY front-end change:
1. If Playwright MCP available: Navigate, screenshot, verify
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Test on mobile viewport
4. Compare against these design standards
5. Self-correct if issues found before presenting

### Reference Documents

Always check these files in `/context/` folder:
- `design-principles.md` - Complete S-Tier checklist
- `anti-vibe-coded-rules.md` - Detailed patterns to avoid
- `premium-ui-system-prompt.md` - Quality mindset

6. Types/interfaces

## AI Behavior Rules

### When generating code:
1. Always read AGENTS.md first for complete context
2. Include error handling in every function
3. Add TypeScript types if project uses TypeScript
4. Include loading and error states in components
5. Make components responsive by default
6. Add accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)

### When reviewing code:

## Component Patterns

### Standard Component Structure
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import styles from './component-name.module.css'

export default function ComponentName({ 
  prop1, 
  prop2 
}) {
  // State declarations
  const [state, setState] = useState(initial)
  
  // Effects
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [dependencies])
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleEvent = async () => {
    try {
      // Handler logic
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error)
      // User-friendly error handling
    }
  }
  
  // Render
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### API Call Pattern
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    setLoading(true)
    setError(null)
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint')
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
    }
    
    const data = await response.json()
    setData(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Fetch error:', error)
    setError('Failed to load data. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

## File Structure Rules

Follow this structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── features/     # Feature-specific components
│   └── layouts/      # Layout components
├── pages/ (or app/)  # Routes
├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── styles/           # Global styles
├── types/            # TypeScript types
└── public/           # Static assets
```

## Database Queries

### Always use parameterized queries
```sql
-- Good
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1

-- Bad  
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'
```

### Include error handling
```javascript
try {
  const result = await db.query(sql, params)
  return result.rows
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Database error:', error)
  throw new Error('Database operation failed')
}
```

## Testing Approach

### For each feature:
1. Test happy path
2. Test error cases
3. Test edge cases
4. Test on mobile
5. Test accessibility

### Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('Feature', () => {
  it('should handle success case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
  
  it('should handle error gracefully', () => {
    // Test error handling
  })
  
  it('should be accessible', () => {
    // Test accessibility
  })
})
```

## Performance Guidelines

1. Lazy load components when possible
2. Optimize images (WebP, proper sizing)
3. Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
4. Use React.memo for expensive components
5. Debounce user input handlers
6. Cache API responses when appropriate

## Security Practices

1. Never store sensitive data in localStorage
2. Validate all user inputs
3. Sanitize data before rendering
4. Use HTTPS for all API calls
5. Implement proper CORS policies
6. Keep dependencies updated

```

## MCP Server Configuration

If using MCP servers for extended functionality:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
      "config": {
        "rootPath": "./",
        "allowedOperations": ["read", "write", "create"]
      }
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"],
      "config": {
        "autoCommit": false,
        "commitMessage": "feat: [description]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Command Patterns

### For Development
```bash
# Start development server
gemini "start the development server and show me the output"

# Create component
gemini "create a new component called [Name] that [description]"

# Debug error
gemini "I'm getting error: [error]. How do I fix it?"

# Test feature
gemini "test the [feature] functionality and report results"
```

### For Learning
```bash
# Explain code
gemini "explain how this code works: [paste code]"

# Best practices
gemini "what's the best way to implement [feature] in [framework]?"

# Architecture
gemini "should I use [approach A] or [approach B] for [use case]?"
```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup
```bash
gemini "Set up a new [framework] project for [App Name]"
gemini "Configure [database/auth service]"
gemini "Create the basic project structure from TechDesign"
```

### Phase 2: Features
```bash
gemini "Implement [feature] from the PRD"
gemini "Add error handling to [feature]"
gemini "Make [feature] mobile responsive"
```

### Phase 3: Polish
```bash
gemini "Add loading states to all async operations"
gemini "Improve error messages to be user-friendly"
gemini "Optimize performance for [specific area]"
```

## Code Generation Preferences

### Component Template
```[language]
// Preferred component structure
import dependencies

export default function ComponentName(props) {
  // State
  // Effects
  // Handlers
  // Render
}
```

### API Pattern
```[language]
// Preferred API structure
export async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Validation
    // Business logic
    // Response
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
  }
}
```

## Error Handling Protocol

When errors occur:
1. Don't panic
2. Explain the error in simple terms
3. Show the exact error message
4. Provide step-by-step fix
5. Verify the fix works

Example interaction:
```bash
User: "I'm getting an undefined error"
Gemini: "Let me help you debug this. First, can you show me:
1. The exact error message
2. The code that's causing it
3. What you were trying to do"
```

## Testing Guidelines

After each feature:
```bash
gemini "Test that [feature] works correctly"
```

Gemini should:
1. Run the application
2. Test the happy path
3. Test error cases
4. Check responsiveness
5. Report results clearly

## Documentation Updates

Gemini should automatically update:
- README.md with setup instructions
- .env.example with new variables
- Comments in complex code
- API documentation

## Progress Tracking

Gemini should track progress in AGENTS.md:
```markdown
### Completed ✅
- [x] Project setup
- [x] Authentication

### In Progress 🔄
- [ ] User dashboard

### Next Up 📋
- [ ] Data visualization
```

```
(Place this file in the project root so Aider automatically loads the instructions.)

---

## Final Instructions

After generating AGENTS.md and the appropriate configuration files based on their tool selection, say:

"I've created your AI agent instruction files above! Here's what you need to do:

## 📁 Files to Save:

1. **AGENTS.md** - Save in your project root directory
   - This is the universal instruction file ALL AI assistants can read

2. **Tool-Specific Config Files** (save the ones for your chosen tools):
   [List the specific files generated based on their selection]

## 📂 Your Project Structure Should Now Look Like:

```
your-app/
├── docs/
│   ├── research-[AppName].txt
│   ├── PRD-[AppName]-MVP.md
│   └── TechDesign-[AppName]-MVP.md
├── AGENTS.md                    ← Universal instructions
├── [Tool-specific files]       ← Based on your selection
└── (your code will go here)
```

## 🚀 Ready to Build! Here's How to Start:

### With [Their Primary Tool]:

[Provide specific starting instructions based on their main tool choice, for example:]

#### If Claude Code:
```bash
cd your-project
claude init  # If first time
claude
# Then say: "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, then start building the MVP"
```

#### If Cursor:
1. Open your project folder in Cursor
2. The .cursorrules file will be automatically detected
3. Start with: "Read AGENTS.md and begin implementing the MVP step by step"

#### If Bolt.new/Lovable:
1. Go to [platform]
2. Create new project
3. Paste your PRD content
4. Say: "Build this following the specifications"


#### If Gemini CLI:
```bash
gemini "Read GEMINI.md, then implement the MVP"
```

#### If Antigravity:
1. Open the project in Antigravity
2. Ensure ANTIGRAVITY.md is loaded as context
3. Start with: "Read AGENTS.md and begin"

#### If Aider:
```bash
aider --continue 
# Aider will automatically load AGENTS.md from .aider.conf.yml
```

## 💡 Your First Prompts:

Based on your level ([their level]), start with:

**First prompt:**
"[Suggested first prompt based on their level and tool]"

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Show me the current progress"
- "Test [feature name] and fix any issues"

- "Deploy to [platform from Tech Design]"

## ✅ Success Checklist:

Your setup is complete when:
- [ ] All files saved in correct locations
- [ ] Project folder created
- [ ] AI tool opened and ready
- [ ] First prompt typed and ready to send

## 🎯 Remember:

- The AI will handle the complex coding
- You guide the direction and test the results
- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Test after each feature
- Don't hesitate to ask for explanations

**You're ready to build! Your AI assistant has all the context it needs. Just start the conversation and watch your MVP come to life!**

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Troubleshooting</b></summary>

**If AI seems confused:**
- Start with: "First, read AGENTS.md completely, then confirm you understand the project"

**If AI skips steps:**
- Say: "Let's go slower. Implement just [specific feature] and show me how to test it"

**If you get errors:**
- Say: "I got this error: [error]. Please explain what it means and how to fix it"

**If AI overcomplicates:**
- Say: "That seems complex. What's the simplest way to make this work for an MVP?"

</details>

Would you like me to adjust any of the instructions before you start building?"
